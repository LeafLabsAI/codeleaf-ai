## ✨ Major Functionalities

1. ⚡ **Eco-Friendly Coding Insights**  
   - Track **energy usage & CO₂ emissions** using CodeCarbon.  
   - Compare “green scores” of different solutions (recursion vs iteration).  
   - Suggest eco-efficient libraries and methods.  

2. 🤖 **AI Code Assistant**  
   - Generate and explain code from natural prompts.  
   - Debug and provide **optimized versions** of inefficient code.  
   - Support multiple languages (Python, JS, Java, C++).  
   - AI-driven best practices for efficiency & readability.  

3. 📊 **Developer Dashboard**  
   - Personalized **Green Report** after each run.  
   - Weekly stats for **energy saved & CO₂ reduced**.  
   - Interactive **charts & visualizations** (Streamlit + Plotly).  

4. 🌍 **Eco-Aware Recommendations**  
   - Integration with APIs like **Electricity Maps** (planned).  
   - Show when running compute-heavy jobs is “greenest” (based on renewable share).  

5. 🧠 **Learning & Community Features** *(upcoming)*  
   - Built-in **green coding tutorials**.  
   - “Did you know?” tips (e.g., vectorized NumPy vs loops).  
   - Share **green badges** on GitHub/LinkedIn.
